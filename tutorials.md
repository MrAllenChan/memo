### Human-Robot Interactioon: Algorithms & Experiments
In this course, students study core engineering, computational, and experimental methods in human-robot interaction (HRI). We cover robot perception, reasoning, AI, and machine learning aspects. [Link](http://hriclass.com/)

### Probabilistic Robotics
This course will introduce basic concepts and techniques used within the field of mobile robotics. We analyze the fundamental challenges for autonomous intelligent systems and present the state of the art solutions. [Link](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ss17/robotics/)
